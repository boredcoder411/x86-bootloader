# todo (in order):
 - get keymap working
 - implement the shift key
 - simple shell
 - get drives working
 - get a filesystem working
 - no more text mode, I want to plot pixels manually (idk how yet)
 - scheduler (port the one I made for the arduino uno) (requires a timer, so reminder to self: google programmable interval timer or whatever its called, you'll remember)
